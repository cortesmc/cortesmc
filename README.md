## 💻 About Me

I'm a Bolivian-Spanish software engineer passionate about data science, maps, and machine learning. My journey began at INSA Lyon in mechanical engineering, but my curiosity for programming and AI led me to pivot into IT.

Since 2022, I’ve been studying data science and software engineering at Polytech Annecy-Chambéry, while working as a Junior Software Engineer at Cassini Conseil, where I build interactive dashboards and geospatial tools for geopolitical analysis.

My work spans a range of topics including:
- Interactive cartography with **Mapbox**, **D3.js**, and **dc.js**
- Machine learning pipelines for satellite image processing (**SAR**, wet snow detection)
- Full-stack development using **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Python**
